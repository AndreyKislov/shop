# shop
This is one of the services in my application.
This service accepts requests from my application's shop-front service and does the bulk of the work. It works with goods, user baskets, creates orders.
For this I used postgres database. And the application itself uses Sping, Sping Data JPA. Security is provided by Spring Security. Access to the service only by JWT token.
